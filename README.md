These are some linux commands that make text processing easier. For natural language processing machine learning projects,
for example, it's more efficient than python. I'm using bash scripts with all the commands to quickly process files as needed, 
for example for regularly updating input data. Probably mostly I'll just add files here when I'm done with them for quick reference.

Here's a sample.
